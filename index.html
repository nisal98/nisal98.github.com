					<h2>Hello There!</h2>
					<p>I’m an international student in MIT's class of 2021 pursuing a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering.
						I am comfortable with a variety of mechanical engineering tools such as 3D printing, manual and CNC machining,
						injection molding and thermoforming. I also have experience with a variety of software tools
						such as Python, MATLAB, C/C++, Fusion 360, Autodesk CFD, Autodesk MoldFlow and Siemens Tecnomatix.
						Outside of class, I have been a part of a variety of research groups
						in the areas of robotics, nanoengineering, metallurgy and business. I've also been a lab assistant for an
						electromechanical systems class for nearly two years.

					</p>
					<p>I am a hobbyist who likes to take apart and tinker with everyday items before improving and rebuilding them.
						During my free time, I enjoy riding my homemade electric motorcycle around Boston, flying FPV drones
						and exploring patches of nature wherever they may exist.</p>

	    <h2>Sensus</h2>
	    <hr>
	    <p>In this class, I and 16 other students work together as a product development firm throughout the semester.
			We start by selecting an idea and then running it through different phases such as high-level physical modelling,
			detailed CAD design review and final manufacturable product.</p>
	  	<p>We decided to make a medical device that automates testing for peripheral neuropathy in users feet by mimicking
			the Semmes-Weinstein test where a doctor would touch the patients foot at different locations with a thin wire
			filament and asks them if they felt the touch.</p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/sensus/1.jpg"></p>
	  	<p><small>The final product. The thermoformed blue inserts are removable so that different ones can be used for people
		 with different foot sizes. This is so that the main housing can be manufactured without changes to tooling.
		The aluminum heel liners are used as a guide for the user to place their feet. They also act as a capacitive touch
		sensor to tell the server that the user has placed their feet on the device </small></p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/sensus/2.jpg"></p>
	  	<p><small>A look at the internal housing and mechanisms</small></p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/sensus/3.jpg" width="800"></p>
	  	<p><small>The stainless steel baseplate of the device without the thermoformed housing.
		There are multiple hole cutouts so that the mechanisms could be adjusted to accomodate various foot sizes</small></p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/sensus/4.jpg" width="800"></p>
	  	<p><small>The actuator mechanism that consists of a servo which moves a platform up that contains the filament which
		 touches the users foot. When the filament touches the foot, a spring gets compressed which activates a switch that tells
		the device that the filament did indeed touch the foot.</small></p>
	  	<br><br>
	  	<p>The device has four main components:</p>
	  	<ol>
			<li><b>Hardware:</b> This is the main device which conducts the test. The hardware has 11 stepper motors for actuation,
				10 limit switches for confirming that the filament contacted the foot and two capacitive touch sensors to
				confirm that the users’ foot is on the device</li>
			<li><b>Server:</b> The server stores the user’s information and test data to keep track of whether the user is
				experiencing nerve degradation. The server is also the medium for communication between the electronics and the app.</li>
			<li><b>App:</b> The smartphone app is the user’s main way of conducting tests. Once the user’s feet are on the
				device, the app allows the user to start the test and once the filament touches the users foot, the app
				asks them if they felt it. The app communicates with the server via get requests.</li>
			<li><b>Electronics:</b> The brain of the hardware is an ESP32 which actuates the motors and relays sensor information
				to the server through get requests. <i>(This is the section that I took ownership of)</i> </li>
		</ol>
	  	<p>Throughout the project, I took ownership of everything to do with electronics. This includes writing Arduino
			code to actuate motors, store sensor information and communicate with the server. I also did all the wiring
			for the electronics using a protoboard. I explored the option of fabricating a PCB but due to time constraints,
			this was out of scope for the class.</p>
		  <p>To simplify wiring, I made two separate protoboard modules. One that has the ESP32 microcontroller and another
			  that distributes 5V and GND to 11 servos and 10 limit switches.</p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/sensus/5.jpg"></p>
		<p><small>The electronics module where the board on the left is the power distribution circuit and the board on the
		right consists of the microcontroller</small></p>
	  	<p><b>ESP32 Circuit</b></p>
	  	<ul>
			<li><b>White wires:</b> The servo data cables through which a PWM signal is sent to control the servo position</li>
			<li><b>Yellow wires:</b> Wires that connect to a metal heel liner for capacitive touch sensing</li>
			<li><b>Red and Black wires:</b> Connects to an external power supply to supply 5V and GND to the ESP32 and sends
				it to the power distribution board</li>
			<li><b>Green wire:</b> A wire that transfers the signals of the 10 limit switches to a single GPIO pin to
				emulate an OR gate with 10 inputs.
				The wire is connected to the ESP32 with an internal pull up resistor to get a digital HIGH/LOW signal input.</li>
		</ul>
	  	<p><b>Power Distribution Circuit</b></p>
	  	<ul>
			<li><b>Red wires:</b> Sends 5V to the power input of the servo cable</li>
			<li><b>Black wires:</b> The GND cable for the servos and connects to one end of the limit switch</li>
			<li><b>Green wires:</b> Connects to the other end of the limit switch which sends a 5V signal when the switch
				contacts are closed</li>
		</ul>
	  	<p>The code on the ESP32 runs through a state machine which checks to see if the user’s feet are on the device and
			the user has told the app to start a test before actuating the motors and receiving feedback from the limit switches.</p>

	    <h2>Microscope Automation and Remote Access</h2>
	    <hr>
	    <p>MIT’s Micro/Nano Engineering Laboratory runs 3 classes where student extensively use compound light microscopes
			to analyze experimental data. Due to restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, students were unable to have
			lab access and conduct these experiments. </p>
	  	<p>I took on the project of finding a solution that allows remote students to have a hands-on lab experience by
			making the microscope controllable and viewable through the internet. I was also tasked with modifying air pressure
			regulators to be remote controlled so that remote students can conduct microfluidic experiments.</p>
	  	<p>This project was run on a tight 1.5-month timeline and I only had access to a 3D printer and a caliper as engineering tools.</p>
	    <p><b>Hardware</b></p>

	  	<p><small>The focus stage was controlled with a minimally invasive, direct drive stepper motor meshed directly to

	  	<p><b>Software</b></p>
	  	<p>I wrote 3 different scripts that run in parallel on a Raspberry Pi 4 to control the microscope. </p>
	  	<ol>
			<li>A keyboard listener that takes the users keyboard inputs to move the microscope stage. The arrow keys
				move the X/Y stage, and the W/S key moves the focus stage </li>
			<li>A GUI which allows users to change how much the stages move and allows users to take photo/videos</li>
			<li>A video feed that shows the microscope image and has a display overlay that tells users their Z height and
				location on the slide</li>
		</ol>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/microscope/3.png"></p>
	  	<p><small>GUI with controls for controlling travel distance per click, picture/video recording and a help button
		which lists out all the controls and features available in the software</small></p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/microscope/4.png"></p>
	  	<p><small>The red window on top right shows relative location on microscope slide. The bordered red square represents the
		whole slide and the filled square represents the section of the slide that is currently viewed.
		The red window on the bottom right represents how much travel is done on the Z axis. The window fills once the user
		starts moving up and down to give them an intuitive understanding of their relative heights and a height readout is
		available if they want to obtain accurate Z height measurements.</small></p>
	  	<p>I introduced a coordinate system that allow users to control the X, Y and Z location with micrometer level precision
			which opens new avenues for obtaining data such as conducting Z height scans. The stages have an auto-homing
			feature where all three stages move to a zero position which allows users to easily change slides and have a consistent
			numerical height reference when taking measurements.</p>

	  	<p>The 6 stepper motors (3 for microscope, 3 for pressure regulators) were connected to a breadboard enclosure which
			contained the A4988 stepper drivers. The connectors on the bottom connected 15 wires to the raspberry pi which
			were used to send signals to the stepper drivers. Each top connector connected to individual stepper motors to power them.</p>
	  	<p>I also designed a custom enclosure which securely held the breadboard, connectors and power jack in place. The lid
			has cutouts for thermal management and has features that allow it to lock onto to the enclosure with a snap fit.</p>

	    <h2>Supernumerary Robotic Limbs</h2>
	    <hr>
	    <p>The d’Arbeloff Lab at MIT developed <a target="_blank" href="http://darbelofflab.mit.edu/robotics-research/supernumerary-robotic-limbs-srl/">Supernumerary Robotic Limbs</a>
			that attach to workers to improve their posture
			when working in environments that can lead to permanent back problems in the long run. When users want to move
			to a different position, they must carry or drag the limbs which weigh over 60lbs. They want to implement a walking
			algorithm for the robot so it can walk with the user and not be an additional weight on them.</p>
	  	<p>I developed small scale robotic limbs to safely test different walking algorithms since there is an inherent
			safety risk of testing the robot with new code with a human in the middle of it. Once the optimal algorithm has been developed,
			it would be scaled up to fit the full-sized robot. These tiny robotic are all 3D printable and weigh around 5lbs.</p>
	  	<p>I wrote a MATLAB script that takes the leg lengths and robot mass to output the usable workspace and torque required.
			Using this script, I decided on a usable leg geometry for the robot.</p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/srl/1.png"></p>
	  	<p>I decided on a symmetric 5 bar linkage to drive the legs since it allows for 2DOF motion while keeping the motor
			mass in the body of the leg to minimize leg inertia and mimic the full-sized robot. The control loop is the main area
			to be tested so the difference in kinematics would not affect the tests.</p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/srl/2.jpg" width="500"></p>
	  	<p>To run motion experiments, I wrote C++ code that runs on a Mbed HELIO microcontroller and transmits data in real
			time to MATLAB through an ethernet connection. The control algorithm I wrote was a hybrid impedance/position control
			feedforward algorithm that allows the robot to walk in a straight line. This is the code that researchers would
			modify to test their control loop.</p>

	    <h2>Oil Filter Cleaning Mechanism</h2>
	    <hr>
	    <p>The HSP46 locomotive has an oil filter that has 60 filter candles used for filtration. These candles are replaced
			every three years due to gunk buildup which costs approximately $180,000 to replace them in the whole fleet.
			I developed and integrated a cleaning mechanism into their maintenance schedule to increase the service life of the candle. </p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/cleaning/1.png"></p>
	  	<p align="center"><small>Oil filter for the locomotive engine</small></p>
	  	<p>After looking at various cleaning methods, I chose a high-pressure cleaning cabinet (Ranger RD500D) used for
			automotive parts cleaning as the cleaning mechanism since it would be the most cost and time efficient cleaning mechanism.</p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/cleaning/2.jpg"></p>
	  	<p>I designed and fabricated a filter candle holder to be placed inside the cabinet for cleaning. Each hole seen
			in the acrylic plate holds a filter candle.</p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/cleaning/3.jpg"></p>
	  	<p>I optimized the hole pattern geometry to maximize the number of filter candles that would be sprayed down.
			The hole pattern is based off the Fibonacci curve for optimal packing of candles.</p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/cleaning/4.png"></p>
	  	<p align="center"><small>Simulation to see if all filter candles would receive water spray evenly.</small></p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/cleaning/5.png"></p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/cleaning/6.png"></p>
	  	<p>I conducted FEA simulations to see if the high-pressure water would bend the structure and cause the candles
			to break. The simulation assumed that the water would apply a force of 50N from a 75PSI water jet. This information
			was obtained from the flow rate data and has a safety factor of 3. Using the simulation results, I increased the
			hole size by 1.4mm to account for bending of the structure.</p>

	    <h2>Headlight Redesign Project</h2>
	    <hr>
	    <p>The HSP46 locomotive has an engine exhaust outlet located on top of it which causes exhaust soot to deposit on
			the headlight and reduce its effectiveness or sometimes block its light down to dangerous levels. I was tasked
			with finding a remedy to the issue.</p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/headlight/1.jpg"></p>
	  	<p>To start off, I designed an accurate CAD model that is to be used for CFD simulations. The
			locomotives do not have any preexisting models, so I modelled it out of their engineering drawings.</p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/headlight/2.jpg" width="800"></p>
		  <p>To verify the accuracy of the CAD, I ran a CFD simulation of the locomotive to see if I could recreate the
			  conditions for soot deposition. The simulation shows that there is a low velocity boundary layer of air flowing
			  over the surface of the locomotive which is where soot deposition would occur.</p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/headlight/3.png" width="800"></p>
		  <p>I designed a headlight cover and ran a CFD simulation to verify that the cover would get rid of soot deposition on the headlight.</p>

	    <h2>Oil System Failure Analysis</h2>
	    <hr>
	    <p>The HSP46 locomotive has a layover pump that keeps warm oil circulating through the engine during the winter.
			It was experiencing an unexpected high-pressure spike that was causing the pump to regularly fail and put the
			locomotive out of service. I conducted root cause failure testing and analysis to remedy the issue.</p>
	  	<p><b>Procedure</b></p>
	  	<ul>
			<li>Install pressure gauges through various points of oil system and conducting tests on the locomotive (Max.
				rated pressure for the pump was 50PSIG, tests show pump experiencing pressures over 130PSIG)</li>
			<li>Write a test report on the results obtained</li>
			<li>Remedy the issue and conduct tests to verify solution success</li>
		</ul>
	  	<p>To conduct these tests, I coordinated and lead a team of technicians which included an electrician to safely
			shut off the pumps PLC, a plumber to install the check valve/ gauges and an engineer to start the train and load the engine.</p>
		<p>Attached here is the full test report which has all the testing data and verification data.
		This report was sent to the MBTA (Parent company) to implement this change on the whole fleet</p>

	    <h2>Lizard Inspired Robotic Leg - (2.74)</h2>
	    <hr>
	    <p>I designed and conducted tests on a robotic leg alongside three other students. We based the limb design to
		mimic a Shovel-Snouted Lizard which can travel a distance of over 20 times its body length in a second.</p>
	  	<p>The hardware consisted of a 2 DOF robotic limb that runs on a belt drive system which is attached to a gantry
		that allows it to freely travel in one direction. When the limb digs into the sand, the robot is propelled forward.</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/74/1.JPG" width="400"></p>
	  	<p>I built a forward Euler simulation model in MATLAB which models the robot kinematics along with its interactions
		with the sand. I then ran an optimization algorithm to find the best leg angle and joint stiffness to get the highest
		velocity when travelling through sand. Using this information, we tested our optimal results on our hardware
		setup to see if it matched.</p>
